These topics having a high proportion of ties indicates that a large percentage of models perform similarly when given questions within this topic. This can indicate to users there's no need to search for a specialized model for handling questions related to these topics.\n",

This indicates that a large percentage of the models in the dataset can answer these questions with similar degrees of accuracy if we're to assume a tie meant both models returned the right or both models had returned the wrong answer.\n",

        "The one topic that is more open ended would be Jokes and Creative Tasks. However since the quality of jokes and creative tasks such as writing prompts can be very subjective, users may not have a criteria in mind to rate a joke, other than if it returned an answer that is related to the prompt given to a satisfactory degree. This may have led to an increase of ties. Since there is no right answer,This may indicate the models all perform similarly in the way of returning data that is relevant to the Joke/Creative prompts.\n",

This means that at least 40% of the time in several of the cases there is a clear winner for the answer to a prompt. Further a majority of the highest cluster tie proportions are under 50%, meaning that over half of the time there's still a clear winner. A potential for further exploration could identify if a certain model winner could be found for each cluster by identifying with model ties + wins the most often. Looking at proportion of wins and ties could further give insight if any model is significantly better at others for a specific topic.\n",
